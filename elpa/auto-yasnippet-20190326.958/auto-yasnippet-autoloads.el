A simplistic `aya-create' to create only one mirror.
You can still have as many instances of this mirror as you want.
It's less flexible than `aya-create', but faster.
It uses a different marker, which is `aya-marker-one-line'.
You can use it to quickly generate one-liners such as
menu.add_item(spamspamspam, \"spamspamspam\")

(autoload 'aya-create "auto-yasnippet" "\
Create a snippet from the text between BEG and END.
When the bounds are not given, use either the current region or line.

Remove `aya-marker' prefixes, write the corresponding snippet to
`aya-current', with words prefixed by `aya-marker' as fields, and
mirrors properly set up.

Call `open-line', unless there are abbrevs or snippets at point.
In that case expand them.  If there's a snippet expansion in progress,
move to the next field.  Call `open-line' if nothing else applies.

To save a snippet permanently, create an empty file and call this.
